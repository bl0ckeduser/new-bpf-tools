		  ==================================
  		  Some documentation on the compiler
		  ==================================

			   ----------
			   Known bugs
			   ----------

	- Division (/ operator) is currently for the x86 codegen.

			 --------------
			 Helper scripts
			 --------------

The scripts to use the x86-targeting compiler are:

	build-x86.sh 		-- build the x86 compiler
	autotest-x86.sh 	-- test the x86 compiler against test/*.c
	compile-run-x86.sh 	-- compile and run a program via x86

Quick example:
	$ sh build-x86.sh 
	$ sh compile-run-x86.sh test/procedure 
	120

The 32-bit x86 code generator outputs GAS assembly and the relevant scripts
assemble this using gcc. clang also works; you can modify the scripts to
use clang if desired.

			**********************

For the BPFVM-targeting compiler the scripts are:

	build.sh		-- build the BPFVM compiler
	autotest.sh		-- test it
	compile-run.sh		-- compile a program and run it using
				   "bpfvm" command

			   ------------
			   The language
			   ------------
			
The language compiled by this compiler is essentially a simple BASIC
with C-inspired syntax and features and built-in support for the 
blokvm instructions. Please see the examples in the "test" directory.

Below is a quick overview of the language syntax. < > symbols denote
an optional part in a construction.

1. Code blocks
	i. empty block
		;
	ii. single-instruction block
		e.g. x += 1;
	iii. multi-instruction blocks
		e.g.
		{
			x += 1;
			y = x + 2;
			if (x > 2)
				++y;
		}

2. Variable declarations
	i. integers
		int variable_name < = expression >;
	ii. arrays
		int array_name[integer];

3. Control flow
	i. if statement
		if (expr)
			block1
		< else
			block2 >
	ii. while statement
		while (expr)
			block

	iii. for statement
		for (<init>; <condition>; <increment>)
			block
	
	     init, condition, increment are expressions.
	     if condition is ommitted, the compiler writes in
	     "1 == 1" (always true) instead.

	     In general, the statement will be rewritten as:

		init;
		while (condition) {
			block;
			increment;
		}

4. Arithmetic
	Operands are any kind of expression: number, variable, array
	index, etc.
	e.g. 
		1 + 2 * 3 		(evaluates to 7)
		(1 + 2) * 3		(evaluates to 9)
		z - x * x + 123		(evalutes to something)	
		-x + 5
		
5. Assignment operators
	Left operand is an lvalue, right operand is an expression.
	e.g.
		x += 3;
		foo += foo * bar;
		variable = 123;
		array[12] = 34;
		z -= 56;

6. lvalues (essentially, objects to which you can assign values)
	e.g.
		table[index]
		variable

7. C-style increments and decrements
	The operand is any lvalue.
	e.g.
		++foo;		tab[bobobo]--;
		--bar;		mystery++;

8. BPF instructions
	e.g.
		echo(1 + 2 * 3);
		wait(1, 2);
		cmx(foo);
		my(foo);
		outputdraw();
		draw(a, 2, c, b * f, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1);

	Please see the BPF VM spec for further info on these.
	Note: mx et al. expect an lvalue as their argument;
	at the moment, array lvalues are not supported for
	this kind of operation -- compiler will give diagnostic
	"That's too tough for me ATM". You can always just use
	a dummy variable, I guess, like this:
		int stor;
		mx(stor);
		array[i] = stor;
	I'll try to do this rewriting automatically at one point.

	[NOTE: "echo" is the only such routine supported by the 32-bit
	x86 codegen]

9. Relational operators
		exprA == exprB
		exprA != exprB
		exprA >= exprB
		exprA <= exprB
		exprA > exprB
		exprA < exprB

   These work fine as in C, but note that C's convention of "nonzero true, 
   zero false" is not use by this compiler. Instead, the convention here is 
   that "expr" is true iff expr <= 0. If you write code that does not depend
   on such conventions there will be no portability or confusion problem.

   [NOTE: The 32-bit x86 code generator follows the C booleans convention;
   the paragraph above applies to the BPFVM code generator].

10. Comments
	/* this is a C-style comment */
	// this is a C++ -style comment.
	// (C++ -style comments last till the end of the line)

11. Keyboard extension (see VM spec part 5, 
    "Keyboard/game-controller interface specification")
    (BPFVM codegen only)

    The compiler automatically provides the identifier "_kbreg"
    for the keyboard register (byte address 0). Here is some sample code:

	/*
	 * Check to see if the VM supports the
	 * keyboard extension. Spec says:
	 * 	If decimal value 240 is written to address 0,
	 *	address 0 must immediately take the value 123.
	 */
	
	int check;

	check = _kbreg = 240;
	if (check == 123)
		echo(1);	/* it does */
	else
		echo(0);	/* it doesn't */

12. Custom procedures (x86 codegen only)

	See examples: test/lexical, test/procedure, test/square,
	test/tco.

	Recursion is allowed. Tail-call optimization is done when it
	can be done. Everything is pass-by-value; passing arrays around
	has not yet been considered by the author and will probably make
	bad things happen. You are allowed to return nothing from a 
	function and even to assign the return value of a function
	returning nothing to a variable. Your computer should not crash,
	but you	will get arbitrary data in the variable. Consider
	the following:

			proc bob() {
				;
			}

			int x = bob();
			echo(x);

	It runs fine for me and I get the result-number 1, which is
	never mentioned anywhere in the program, nor in the
	generated assembly. What a mystery.

.............................................................................

			Operator precedence table
			-------------------------

From greatest to lowest precedence:

	unary -, ( ), ++, --, procedure calls
	* /
	+ -
	> >= < <= == !=
	= += -= *= /=

I'll get back to you later about associativity.

.............................................................................
		
		Hints concerning the BPFVM code generator
		-----------------------------------------

This compiler assumes VM behaviour about which the specification is 
ambiguous. This behaviour is that "PtrTo X" will store to X the address 
of the beggining of the following instruction rather than the address of its 
own beggining.

Be careful not to overuse array expressions. They are expensive
in bytes of memory and bytes of program code, because I have to use a special
routine to make them work since the VM doesn't provide indirection / array
indexing facilities.

.............................................................................

		      -----------------------------
		      Compilation / running process
			  (for the BPFVM target)
		      -----------------------------

Considering the following example program:

	int t = 5;
	int a = 1;
	int b = 0;

	while (t-- > 0) {
		echo(a += b);
		echo(b += a);
	}

The first phase of compilation is converting the program to a sequence 
of tokens. The relevant code is in tokenizer.c and is invoked thus in main.c:

	setup_tokenizer();
	tokens = tokenize(buf);

Here is the resulting token-stream for the program:

	0: TOK_INT: int
	1: TOK_IDENT: t
	2: TOK_ASGN: =
	3: TOK_INTEGER: 5
	4: TOK_SEMICOLON: ;
	5: TOK_INT: int
	6: TOK_IDENT: a
	7: TOK_ASGN: =
	8: TOK_INTEGER: 1
	9: TOK_SEMICOLON: ;
	10: TOK_INT: int
	11: TOK_IDENT: b
	12: TOK_ASGN: =
	13: TOK_INTEGER: 0
	14: TOK_SEMICOLON: ;
	15: TOK_WHILE: while
	16: TOK_LPAREN: (
	17: TOK_IDENT: t
	18: TOK_MINUSMINUS: --
	19: TOK_GT: >
	20: TOK_INTEGER: 0
	21: TOK_RPAREN: )
	22: TOK_LBRACE: {
	23: TOK_ECHO: echo
	24: TOK_LPAREN: (
	25: TOK_IDENT: a
	26: TOK_PLUSEQ: +=
	27: TOK_IDENT: b
	28: TOK_RPAREN: )
	29: TOK_SEMICOLON: ;
	30: TOK_ECHO: echo
	31: TOK_LPAREN: (
	32: TOK_IDENT: b
	33: TOK_PLUSEQ: +=
	34: TOK_IDENT: a
	35: TOK_RPAREN: )
	36: TOK_SEMICOLON: ;
	37: TOK_RBRACE: }

The next two steps are making a parse-tree out of this and simplifying 
this parse tree. These passes are accomplished by the files parser.c 
and optimize.c respectively. They are invoked thusly:

	tree = parse(tokens);
	optimize(&tree);

Here is the optimized parse-tree for the program:

	(BLOCK (INT_DECL (VARIABLE:t) (NUMBER:5)) (INT_DECL (VARIABLE:a) 
	(NUMBER:1)) (INT_DECL (VARIABLE:b) (NUMBER:0)) (WHILE (GT 
	(POST_DEC (VARIABLE:t)) (NUMBER:0)) (BLOCK (BPF_INSTR:echo 
	(ASGN (VARIABLE:a) (ADD (VARIABLE:a) (VARIABLE:b)))) 
	(BPF_INSTR:echo (ASGN (VARIABLE:b) (ADD (VARIABLE:b) 
	(VARIABLE:a)))))))

Finally, the code generator turns this tree into BPF instructions ready 
to be converted to bytes by the fairly simple "assembler" program:

	PtrTo 0
	Do 1 10 1 5
	Do 2 10 1 1
	Do 3 10 1 0
	PtrTo 4
	Do 231 10 1 0
	Do 232 10 2 1
	Do 1 30 1 1
	Do 231 30 2 232
	Do 230 10 2 231
	Do 230 20 1 1
	Do 233 10 1 36 
	zbPtrTo 230 0 233
	Do 230 10 2 2
	Do 230 20 2 3
	Do 2 10 2 230
	Echo 2
	Do 230 10 2 3
	Do 230 20 2 2
	Do 3 10 2 230
	Echo 3
	PtrFrom 4

The compiler program accepts program source as standard input and
gives back the assembly as standard output. So here are the shell
commands to compile the program "test/if.c" to a binary file ready to
be run in the VM:

  $ ./a.out <test/fib.c >fib.asm
  $ ../bpf-asm/bpfasm ../bpf-asm/black.bmp ../bpf-asm/black.bmp fib.asm fib.BPF

Finally, the compiled binary file can be run in the VM:

  $ bpfvm fib.BPF 
  reading fib.BPF
  1
  1
  2
  3
  5
  8
  13
  21
  34
  55
  $ 
	
The helper scripts (see top of this document) make this process somewhat
easier by doing  several of these steps automatically.
