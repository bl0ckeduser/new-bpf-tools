This a new [December 2012] set of programming tools for my 
ancient [2007; I was a very big noob] "BPF" virtual machine. 
This project is meant as a personal exercise in compiler programming.

Implementations of the "BPF" VM:

bpf-asm
=======
An assembler. complete.

bpf-compiler
============
Pseudo-BASIC-with-C-like syntax compiler. work in progress.
(At a fairly advanced stage of completion.)

The compiler's codegen could be written to generate code for a more
interesting VM or maybe even a real computer. Or the compiler could be 
improved, merged with a well-designed VM and hacked into a big REPL to create 
a script interpreter.
