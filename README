This project is a personal exercise in compiler programming.

It consists mainly in a compiler for a subset of C (with somewhat modified
syntax, for now). It targets 32-bit x86 (via GNU assembler). It can also 
target my terrible old bytecode VM, arbitrarily named "BPF" -- for details, 
see "README-BPF".

Note that the BPF compiler supports a much smaller subset of C than does 
the x86 compiler.

The x86 compiler is tested on FreeBSD and Linux. It can also be built
and used on Windows using MinGW, but I haven't tested that recently.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future project ideas: 

The compiler could be improved, merged with a well-designed VM and 
hacked into a big REPL to create a script interpreter.

Supporting a larger subset of C ? Not sure if it would be possible to
do this by growing this code.

Support for other real architectures than x86, say e.g. powerpc or arm 
(PowerPC does not look easy.)

Support for popular serious VMs like JVM / .NET / LLVM
