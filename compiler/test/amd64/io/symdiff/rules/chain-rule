% This is what I believe to be a correct formulation
% of the chain-rule for derivatives in the language
% of this matching system. Note that it uses the
% function-name-matching feature (accessed through
% the '$' symbol), as well as the match for an expression
% containing another but not equal to it ("::" symbol).

D(@var, $func(e::var)) = D(e, func(e)) * D(var, e)

% Chain-rule for powers...
D(@var, e::var ^ #u) = u * e ^ (u - 1) * D(var, e)

% Chain-rule for exponential
D(@var, e^(u::var)) = D(u, e^u) * D(var, u)
