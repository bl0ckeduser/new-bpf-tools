% Basic derivative rules, based on those presented in SICP,
% section 2.3. The syntax is not the same.
%
% Syntax:
% D(VARIABLE, EXPRESSION) => derivative of EXPRESSION with
%			     respect to VARIABLE.
%
%
% Syntax notes:
% -------------
% e|x means "any expression e without any occurence
% of x in it"
%
% @x means a non-number symbol x
% #n means a number n

D(x, e|x) = 0
D(@x, x) = 1
D(@x, u * v) = u * D(x, v) + v * D(x, u)
D(@x, -(u:x)) = -D(x, u)
