State of things on MinGW, as of 2013-12-17
==========================================

everything seems good

all the autotests seem ok

the ccc2012-s5 io test no longer fails

---
from last test session:

minilisp io test works great, euler59 works great too.
euler11, euler22, permut, also work.

scanf, scanf2 work ok
