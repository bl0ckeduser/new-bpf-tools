State of things on MinGW, as of 2013-12-08
==========================================

Failed test cases:

test/x86/array-init.c - FAIL
test/x86/arrow-2.c - FAIL

test/x86/arrow-2.c crashes the compiler.
Some kind of memory bug relating to trees,
mingw gdb can't seem to catch it.
Should try valgrind on linux.

test/x86/array-init.c compiles ok, but outputs some
weird garbage at runtime. the correct output has the
first line: "hahaha", but the output compiled with
wannabe compiler looks like: "hahahaPubPuˆó("

some trivial tests randomly fail sometimes, maybe the
autotesting script is doing something stupid

---------------

the io test case ccc2012-s5.c fails too, at runtime,
int he spot marked with big arrows:


# >>> compiled code for 'main'
_tco_main:
movl $0, -28(%ebp)
subl $12, %esp
movl $_str_const_0, %esi
>>>>>>	movl %esi, 0(%esp)	# argument 0 to scanf		<<<<<<<<
leal -12(%ebp), %esi
movl %esi, 4(%esp)	# argument 1 to scanf
leal -16(%ebp), %esi
movl %esi, 8(%esp)	# argument 2 to scanf
call _scanf
addl $12, %esp	# throw off args

-------------------

minilisp io test works great, euler59 works great too.
euler11, permut, also work. euler22 seems to get stuck
in a loop in the namesorting thing

scanf, scanf2 work ok
