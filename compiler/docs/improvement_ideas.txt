On April 4, 2014, a link to the repository was posted to the programming
discussion page on reddit.com. (for those who don't know it, reddit.com 
is basically like a forum).

(http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2277wu/i_wrote_a_c_compiler_as_a_hobby_currently_targets/)

Quickly, I received lots of improvement suggestions messages.
I make a list here.

- Improving the style of the massive run-on `codegen' routine
  in codegen_x86.c

- Reading the C standard ! unofficial pre-publication draft:
  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf

- Avoiding conditional compilation (ex-Borland guy)
  Can do:

	#ifdef SOMETHING
		#define something 1
	#else
		#define something 0
	#endif

  then:

	if (something) {
		...
	}

- Emitting object code directly is harder but much faster. (from Mr. Bright
  who did the D compiler)

- Targeting 64-bit instead of 32-bit. Better instruction set,
  and most computers are 64-bit now.

- Reading the AMD documentation. Apparently more readable than Intel

- Always using meaningful variable names.

- Avoid using gcc extensions in the compiler source.
  (I don't think it does)

- "unit tests" (?)

- doing more fun things with my life than this. (well  "fun" is subjective)

- code style (direct dump of a message I got from "mumbel" on reddit):

	- you might get some performance increase if you passed 
	  all those structs by reference instead of as a parameter 
	  to save the copy.
	- consider putting using the heap more (alloc vs stack variable).
	- label 'const' to parameters that are read-only.
	- use header files for function prototypes, instead of having 
	  to extern each time.
	- declare functions as (void) instead of ().
	- compile with "-Wall -Wextra" to see if any of those are 
	  important, looks like mostly signed/unsigned comparisons, 
	  unused variables, and no returns (should go away by 
	  adding "__attribute__((noreturn))" to the function 
	  prototypes that call exit() if they really dont return)
