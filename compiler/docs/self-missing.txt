Features used but not compiled by the x86 compiler
==================================================

- function pointers (used in parser.c) (!)
- multiple files (presumably largely the linker's job)
	UPDATE: currently WIP
- preprocessor: #define #else #endif #ifdef #ifndef #include
	UPDATE: basic #define is implemented. local file #include
	        with recursion implemented.
- external constants: NULL (for now can say "long NULL = 0x0" but 
			    that makes real C angry because it conflits
			    with the standard headers...)
   (wait, isn't NULL a #define ?) (doesn't this fall under "extern" ?)

- "static" qualifier (!!!) -- and to make things worse, I think 
   it has multiple meanings

- "unsigned" qualifier -- I commented these out, not really needed

- complicated struct-array-initializations (used by kw_tab)
 (e.g. struct foo bob[] = {{"a",0},...... etc)
  either fails with a message saying it's unsupported in global scope,
  or a cryptic debugging message that looks like:

	codegen_x86: incapable of coding tree:
	(ASGN (VARIABLE:kw_tab) (COMPLICATED_INITIALIZER....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- switch/case/break/default
  UPDATE: well they seem to be mostly working now.
- enumerations
  e.g. enum { A = 0, B, C, ..., Z};
  UPDATE: mostly working now
- adjacent string concatenation	-- update: now DONE
- function prototypes
  e.g. typedesc_t tree_typeof_iter(typedesc_t, exp_tree_t*);
  UPDATE: some support for these. the main lacks at this point are:
    - blablabla blablabla(void), specifically the `(void)' thing
    - meta update: (void) should be working now
    - anal type conflict checking (would probably require an
      complicated recursive parallel tree walk, aghdsjdsfsd)
    - it seems not to work for empty () in some cases (!!!!!)
- struct and array initializers
  e.g. bob[] = {"a", "b", "c"}
  e.g. exp_tree_t null_tree = { 58, 0x0, 0, 0, 0x0 };
  e.g. char symtab[256][256] = {""};
  UPDATE: array initializers are a work-in-progress

- struct function return types (used in parser.c -- e.g. "exp_tree_t block();")
  UPDATE: added 2014-03-11
- structs as function arguments
  UPDATE: added 2014-03-11

- "extern" prototypes
	UPDATE: done for functions, done for variables
