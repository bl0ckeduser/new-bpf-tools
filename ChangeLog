0.4 - April 13, 2014

- achieved self-compilation, self-self-compilation, etc. :)
- multifile support
- basic preprocessor: local recursive #include, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif,
                      simple #define without macros
- parse and x86-compile "extern" declarations
- added some useful notes to the docs
- make a list of improvement ideas people sent from reddit
  (there was a big thread on reddit.com/r/programming around April 4)
- improve coding style following suggestions
- wcc: --version, --help flags
- several tweaks so that the compiler could compile itself
- cleaned up lots of old hackish code that was broken
- add a compatibility hack so that NULL and FILE* are defined
  to 0 and void *, respectively
- wcc: added -Ddefine[=val]... flag (preprocessor define injection)
- new line tracking (i.e. for diagnostics) mechanism, shows file name
- x86: improved support for structs-within-structs
- x86: fixed array to pointer conversion in assignments
- parser: fix parsing of goto statements
- x86: fixed a register fuckup
- x86: fixed sizeof() for structs
- x86: implement a->b = c for large structs

0.1 - December 18, 2013

0.1 is the first tagged "release". I made it because I fixed most of
the serious bugs I know of at this point, tested it on BSD/Linux/Windows,
and because it's been exactly one year since the first commit.
