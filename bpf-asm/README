This is not an x86 assembler.

This is an "assembler" for a special graphics virtual machine target,
(called "BPF"), which is no longer the main focus of the compiler.

This compiler originally targeted this "BPF" virtual machine which I 
(terribly) designed when I was about 13 years old. Later it was
adapted to target x86.

bpfasm.c is an "assembler" for this virtual machine. It converts 
"assembly code" (text instructions) to "executable files" for 
this virtual machine.

The focus of this project is now the x86 version.

In ../bpf-test/ are games programmed for that virtual machine,
to be compiled using the compiler.
