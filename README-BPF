The "bpf-asm" directory contains an "assembler" for BPF bytecodes.

The "compiler" directory contains a pseudo-BASIC-with-C-like syntax 
compiler. Let's say it's 99% complete; all the things I could initially 
think of are there, but I could make small additions or fix bugs etc.

The "bpf-test" directory in the main directory here contains complete
test programs, but there also "test" subdirectories for the BPF compiler
and assembler.

Below are links to some "BPFVM" bytecode interpreters.
Both include the VM specs document and some demo programs in their tree.

 * https://github.com/bl0ckeduser/blokvm
	Was made in collaboration with darkf. Single clean 294-line
	SDL/C file.

 * https://sites.google.com/site/bl0ckeduserssoftware/past-projects#oldvm
	Made by me. 461 lines of SDL/C code spread across a few files.
	Not as lean as blokvm, but faster and more polished.
